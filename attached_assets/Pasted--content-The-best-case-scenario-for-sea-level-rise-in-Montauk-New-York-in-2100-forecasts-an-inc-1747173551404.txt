Here are the key predictions from recent research:\n\n## Projections for 2100\n\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), sea levels in New York City are expected to rise between 2.5 feet and 6.5 feet by the year 2100 [1]. Specific areas at highest risk include:\n\n- Battery Park City and the East Side of Manhattan\n- LaGuardia Airport (potentially half submerged under a 6-foot rise scenario)\n- Neighborhoods in Hamilton Beach, Montauk, and Westhampton\n- Coastal areas of Long Island, including Long Beach and Coney Island [2][3]\n\n## Projections for 2050\n\nFor the nearer term, Climate Central projections for 2050 indicate more limited but still significant impacts:\n\n- Manhattan would remain mostly safe, with only the outermost edges experiencing water encroachment\n- The Brooklyn Navy Yard would experience some water inundation\n- Southern coast of Long Island and barrier islands would be most at risk\n- Coastal neighborhoods in Suffolk and Nassau counties, including Freeport and Island Park [4]\n\n## Long-Term Outlook\n\nLooking beyond 2100, the situation becomes more severe:\n\n- If all ice sheets were to melt (a process that would take centuries to thousands of years), sea levels could rise by up to 216 feet\n- In such an extreme scenario, Long Island would completely disappear, as would most or all of New York City [3]\n- Antarctica's ice sheet alone holds enough water to raise sea levels by more than 190 feet, but its collapse is estimated to occur in approximately 2,000 years (with estimates ranging from 500 to 13,000 years) [3]\n\nClimate experts emphasize that major cities like New York will likely implement significant adaptation measures. The city has already invested billions in infrastructure resiliency since Superstorm Sandy, including projects like the $200 million Battery Coastal Resilience project, which aims to elevate a stretch of shoreline by 5 feet [1].\n\nSources:\n[1] https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/parts-of-nyc-could-be-underwater-by-2100-map-shows-areas-most-at-risk/\n[2] https://daily.jstor.org/new-york-city-underwater/\n[3] https://www.newsweek.com/new-york-map-state-sea-level-rise-underwater-1887881\n[4] https://www.newsweek.com/new-york-map-cities-underwater-2050-1999930"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Transferring back to supervisor'}, {'type': 'tool_use', 'name': 'transfer_back_to_supervisor',
