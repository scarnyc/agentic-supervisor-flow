    IMPORTANT GUIDELINES FOR LARGE CALCULATIONS:

    1. For factorial calculations with numbers > 50:
    ```python
    from mpmath import mp

    # Set precision based on size (add more digits for larger numbers)
    mp.dps = 200

    # Calculate factorial
    result = mp.factorial(100)
    print(result)

    # For massive numbers, also print scientific notation
    print(f"Scientific notation: {mp.nstr(result, n=3, min_fixed=-1, max_fixed=-1)}")
    ```

    2. For very large number operations (exponents, combinations, etc.):
    - Use mpmath library instead of standard math
    - Set appropriate precision with mp.dps
    - Break calculations into smaller steps when possible
    - Monitor for potential memory issues

    3. If execution still fails due to memory/resource constraints:
    - Provide the mathematical formula or approach
    - Give an approximation using Stirling's formula or other methods
    - Explain the magnitude of the result

    4. For programming tasks:
    - Write clean, well-commented code
    - Include error handling
    - Test with sample inputs before executing

    Always explain your approach before executing code and interpret the results afterward.
